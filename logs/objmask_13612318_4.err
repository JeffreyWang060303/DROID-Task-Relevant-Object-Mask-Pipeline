/vision/u/yinhang/miniconda3/envs/sam3/lib/python3.12/site-packages/torch/backends/__init__.py:46: UserWarning: Please use the new API settings to control TF32 behavior, such as torch.backends.cudnn.conv.fp32_precision = 'tf32' or torch.backends.cuda.matmul.fp32_precision = 'ieee'. Old settings, e.g, torch.backends.cuda.matmul.allow_tf32 = True, torch.backends.cudnn.allow_tf32 = True, allowTF32CuDNN() and allowTF32CuBLAS() will be deprecated after Pytorch 2.9.
